# One way ANOVA test
one.way<-aov(yield~fertilizer,data = crop.data)
summary(one.way)
# Since low p-value and high f-value then fertilizer is a significant variable.

# Two way ANOVA test
two.way<-aov(yield~as.factor(fertilizer)+as.factor(density),data = crop.data)
summary(two.way)
# Reduced the sum of squares for residuals, also low p-value for density and high f-value. Both independent variables have an effect on yield.

# Interaction test
interaction<-aov(yield~fertilizer*density,data = crop.data)
summary(interaction)
# High p-value and low f-value, fertilizer and density do not interact with each other just add to each other.

# Adding blocking varivale 
blocking <- aov(yield ~ fertilizer + density + block, data = crop.data)
summary(blocking)
# Since block variable has a low f-value and a high p-value it does not have much significance to the data.

# AIC method

# Residuals vs fitted, scale-location, and residuals vs leverage all had nearly horizontal red lines, meaning that there are no significant outliers 
# Q-Q plot has a near 1 linear slop so it is a good plot as well.

# Since p-value <.05 for fertilizer groups 3-1 and 3-2 we can see that there are significant differences between the groups. 
# Groups 2-1 have a higher p-value so we know that there are not significant differences between the groups.
# Was getting error for Tukey test, had to go back and make variables in two.way factors.
